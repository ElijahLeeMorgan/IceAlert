---

## 1. Executive summary
Briefly describe the prediction goal, intended use, and key conclusion/contribution of the report.

---

## 2. Purpose and scope
- Purpose: Describe why predictions are needed and what decisions they will inform.  
- Scope: Systems, time horizon, inputs, and outputs covered.  
- Out of scope: Explicit exclusions and limitations.

---

## 3. Definitions and assumptions
- Key terms (prediction, model, feature, ground truth, etc.).  
- Operational assumptions (availability of data, update cadence, constraints).

---

## 4. Data sources and collection
- Inventory of data sources (internal logs, sensors, external feeds).  
- Collection methods and frequency.  
- Data access, storage location, ownership.  
- Data quality checks and provenance tracking.

---

## 5. Data preparation
- Cleaning steps (missing values, outliers, normalization).  
- Labeling strategy and ground truth generation.  
- Partitioning (training, validation, test) and sampling methods.  
- Feature selection and transformation summary.

---

## 6. Feature engineering
- Candidate features and rationale.  
- Derived features and aggregation windows.  
- Handling categorical variables and temporal data.  
- Feature importance/explainability approach.

---

## 7. Modeling approaches
- Candidate model families (statistical, machine learning, rules-based).  
- Model selection criteria (accuracy, latency, interpretability, resource cost).  
- Baseline and benchmark models.  
- Hyperparameter tuning strategy.

---

## 8. Evaluation and validation
- Metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, RMSE, calibration).  
- Cross-validation or holdout strategy.  
- Backtesting and temporal validation for time-dependent systems.  
- Stress tests, edge cases, and failure mode analysis.

---

## 9. Uncertainty, calibration, and confidence
- Methods to quantify uncertainty (confidence intervals, prediction intervals, ensembles).  
- Calibration techniques and assessment.  
- How uncertainty is communicated in outputs and decisions.

---

## 10. Decision logic and thresholds
- How predictions map to actions (thresholds, risk buckets).  
- Cost of false positives vs false negatives and threshold selection process.  
- Human-in-the-loop escalation paths.

---

## 11. Deployment and integration
- Runtime environment and resource requirements.  
- APIs, data pipelines, and latency expectations.  
- Versioning, rollout strategy, and feature flags.  
- Infrastructure monitoring and alerting.

---

## 12. Monitoring, maintenance, and drift detection
- Operational metrics to monitor (performance, data distribution, latency).  
- Drift detection methods and retraining triggers.  
- Retraining frequency and model lifecycle management.

---

## 13. Reproducibility and auditability
- Experiment tracking (parameters, artifacts, datasets).  
- Model registry and immutable deployment artifacts.  
- Logging for audit trails and explainability.

---

## 14. Security, privacy, and compliance
- Data minimization and retention policies.  
- Access controls and encryption.  
- Regulatory constraints and audit requirements.

---

## 15. Ethical considerations
- Bias identification and mitigation strategies.  
- Fairness metrics and stakeholder impact assessment.  
- Transparency and user notification policies.

---

## 16. Risks and limitations
- Known failure modes and edge scenarios.  
- Data limitations and potential sources of error.  
- Contingency plans and human oversight expectations.

---

## 17. Recommendations and next steps
- Short-term actions (pilots, data collection needs).  
- Medium/long-term roadmap (scaling, governance).  
- Resource and tooling recommendations.

---

## 18. Appendix
- A: Evaluation results (tables/figures).  
- B: Data schema and sample records.  
- C: Glossary.  
- D: Change log.

---

## 19. References
List relevant standards, papers, and internal documents.
